== Description ==

India's emerging C2C payments & e-commerce platform.

We make digital commerce universally accessible to create newer opportunities & sustainable livelihoods.

We believe every business idea deserves to be on the Internet to grow. But very few can. We make it possible with technology, data, design and little bit of Mojo (​noun | mo·jo | meaning magic​).
